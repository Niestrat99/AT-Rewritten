# Contributing to AdvancedTeleport
AdvancedTeleport is a rapidly growing teleportation plugin that prides itself in continuous improvements and new features that help server owners control how teleportation works to the best of their ability. It is placed under the [GNU General Public License v3.0](https://github.com/Niestrat99/AT-Rewritten/blob/master/LICENSE) (like most plugins should), which should be read along with the [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/Niestrat99/AT-Rewritten/blob/export-import-hooks/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) before making any form of contribution.

## Bug Reports
Bug reports should be made using the following [issue template](https://github.com/Niestrat99/AT-Rewritten/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=bug_report.md&title=%5BBUG%5D). Before making an issue, please ensure that no other issue exists highlighting the same bugs. You are able to create a separate bug report if you find a bug is related to another existing issue. Do not hijack other issues with unrelated problems or questions.

## Pull Requests
Before opening a pull request, it is recommended - although not necessarily enforced - to propose the changes you want to make in the issue tracker using the appropriate template (bug or feature request). If the issue is already opened, please reference it in your pull request. 

You are welcome to make minor adjustments and updates to dependencies outside of Hacktoberfest. If one is made within the event, it will be promptly rejected. During this month, a meaningful contribution must be made.

## Expectations 
### Bug Reports
When you submit a bug report to the AdvancedTeleport issue tracker, where necessary, you are expected to:
- Be detailed when an issue can be considered vague or hard to reproduce.
- Check existing issues, both opened and closed, that could cover the bug you found.
- Check the developer builds for existing fixes.
- Abide by our code of conduct and remain respectful to both developers, contributors and other issue reporters.

As developers, we are expected to:
- Remain transparent with a user about a specified issue.
- If there is a workaround that is not considered sustainable, then it should be provided, but the issue will remain open until a proper fix is implemented.
- Annotate and triage issues appropriately.
- Abide by our code of conduct and remain respectful, whether or not the report is valid or not.
- Prioritise bug reports over feature requests.

### Pull Requests
When you submit a pull request to the AdvancedTeleport repository, you are expected to:
- Write either a brief summary or description of what your PR entails.
- Test every aspect of the plugin that your PR changes.
- Account for as many use cases as possible - make the PR as applicable as you can think of.
- Maintain an organised code format. For any files you edit, it is recommended that you reformat the code before making a pull request. (In IntelliJ, you can do this by doing CTRL+ALT+L)
- Use grammatically correct English in any implemented custom messages and store them all in the CustomMessages class file. If English is not your native tongue and you are unsure on a translation, reach out to a developer and they will be happy to assist you.
- Follow the colour scheme of the plugin where possible; use AQUA for key words/variables (e.g. &b{warp}) and LIGHT_GRAY for anything else (e.g. &7You've been teleported!).
- Ensure that implemented custom messages are as readable as possible so key information is made clear to the end-user.
- Ensure that implemented custom messages are clear and concise, i.e. not vague.
- Respond appropriately to developer feedback and adjust your pull request accordingly.
- Abide by our code of conduct and remain respectful to both developers and contributors.

As developers, we are expected to:
- Respond and review your PR accordingly and to the fullest.
- Test every aspect of the plugin that your PR changes.
- Provide you with any feedback that is believed to be deemed necessary for the function to fit in the plugin safely.
- Abide by our code of conduct and remain respectful.
