# In other words, this gives up the command for other plugins to use.

# - accept - Cooldown starts only when the teleport request is accepted (with /tpyes) and still applies even if no teleport takes place (i.e. cancelled by movement).
# - teleport - Cooldown starts only when the teleport actually happens.
# Note:
# 'request' and 'accept' behave the same for /rtp, /back, /spawn, /warp, and /home
# cooldown for /tpall always starts when the command is ran, regardless if any player accepts or teleports

# If you want to use items, use the format MATERIAL:AMOUNT or MATERIAL:AMOUNT:BYTE.

# If you're on a legacy version and unsure on what byte to use, see https://minecraftitemids.com/types

# To combine multiple rules, use a ; - e.g. stop-teleportation-out;stop-teleportation-within

# To do the opposite (i.e. initiates the rule when users are not in the specified world), use !, e.g. stop-teleportation-into!world stops teleportation into a specific world if they are not in "world".

# To combine multiple rules, use a ;.
# To make rules behave differently in different worlds, use : to initiate the rule in a specific world (e.g. override:world to make the command override "world"'s rules.)
# To initiate rules outside of a specific world, use ! (e.g. override!world to make the command override world rules everywhere but in world)
# To use multiple worlds, use a comma (,).
# By default, all commands will comply with the world rules. If no rules are specified, they will comply.
# All worlds specified will be considered the world in which the player is currently in. For worlds being teleported to, add > to the start of the world name.
# For example, ignore:world,>world_nether will not run if the player is in "world" or if the player is going into the Nether.
