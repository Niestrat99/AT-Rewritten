Advanced Teleport is a rapidly growing plugin that is not only increasing sharply in users, but also potential as it continues adding new features that help teleportation become more accessible and easier to manage. Existing features include:

- Handling of teleportation requests
- Ability to handle multiple requests
- Returning to previous locations or death locations
- Blocking and unblocking users who can send requests
- Random Teleportation. (As of v5.3, this is far more efficient in comparison to common plugins!)
- Pre-teleportation warm-ups, which options on whether to cancel upon movement or rotation.
- Per-command cooldowns.
- Per-command prices, using Vault or EXP.
- Sound alerts for /tpa and /tpahere.
- A distance limiter, which stops players teleporting beyond a specific distance.
- A world teleportation limiter, which stops players teleporting to, from or within a world.
- A homes feature, allowing players to set homes.
- A warps feature.
- An accessible homes and warps list, where you can click a home/warp and get teleported.
- A spawn feature.
- A per-world respawning mechanism.
